            <p>How often have you pasted something from the Window's clipboard only to realize you accidently copied something over the text you wanted to paste? For me it happened all the time, which is why I created ClipFlow. ClipFlow is a much more powerful way to use Windows clipboard which allows you to save many text entries to ClipFlow and add them to windows clipboard at will. Here is how it works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Copy text to windows clipboard as you normally do</li>
                <li>Left Click ClipFlow's tray icon</li>
                <p><i>Your Text is now in ClipFlow's memory.</i></p>
                <li>Continue to add items at will using steps 1-2.</li>
                <li>When you are ready to recall an item, simply right click ClipFlow and then left click the item you want to add to the windows clipboard</li>
                <p><i>Paste item as normal</i></p>
                <li>To delete from ClipFlow simply right click ClipFlow, hold control button, and right click the item to remove.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>Now is as good a time as any to start simplifying your day to day text entry. Think about it: how many times a day do you paste something? That's a lot of back and forth copying and pasting between multiple places. Now imagine that you can read through a document one time, adding text to clipflow as you go and then visually pick the items to paste into your destination document later! That could save you quite a bit of time.</p>
                <p>ClipFlow will get the following features in the future:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Save items at ClipFlow exit</li>
                <li>Hotkeys for simplified use of ClipFlow</li>
                <p>key to display clipboard text, copy and paste overridden for ClipFlow usage instead of windows clipboard</p>
            </ol>
