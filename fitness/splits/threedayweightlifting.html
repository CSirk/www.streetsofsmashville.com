                    <p>
                        Great for lifters on a time budget, or newer to lifting. This is a great split to focus on specific parts
                        of the body such as push-trained upper body muscles, pull-trained upper body muscles, and lower body muscles.

                    <h3>Push/Pull/Legs</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind a push/pull/legs split is to group exercises by their specific motion types. By grouping exercises in this way, you guarantee that you will both get effective workouts and also keep your muscles from being too sore to workout the next group the next workout. Legs are completed on the third day, as they are a large enough group to warrant their own focused day. The day after a three day split is recommended to be a rest day before completing the 3 day split again the day after and so on.

                    <h3>Upper/Lower/Core</h3>
                    <p>
                        The upper/lower/core split divides workouts into upper body, lower body, and core muscle groups. This type of split allows for specific parts of the bady to be targeted so that soreness is contained and does not affect the next workouts in the group. The upper body consists of the arms, shoulders, and chest, the lower body consists of the legs, and the core consists of the abdominal muscles and back muscles. While the abdominals are often grouped with either lower or upper body workouts, adding them to a 3 day split allows you to incorporate cardio alongside your core workout in order to help sculpt your body and to banish fat from your middle.
